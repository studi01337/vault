Bonjour Boost your Productivity (je n'ai pas trouvé votre prénom) 

Je m'appel louis, je suis programmeur indépendant et j'ai créé un framework pour pouvoir publier mes notes et projets markdown, en ligne, simplement. J'ai aussi intégré le framework dans un plugin obsidian, proposant ainsi une alternative à leur offre Publish. Après 6 mois de conception intenses et de tests en production, je cherche enfin à mettre le kit dans les mains de la communauté markdown et obsidian.

Je ne sais pas trop par ou commencer c'est vrai :) mais comme je suis abonné de ta chaine depuis quelque mois déjà, et que tu maitrises obsidian, c'est probable que mon projet t'interesses.

Je serais ravi de te présenter l'outil, mais aussi simplement d'échanger en tant qu'utilisateur aggueris d'obsidian :)

je suis joignable à tout moment au 0608022073

Au plaisir

Louis

bonjour à tous, je sors enfin de ma grotte après 6mois de création intense ^^ j'ai crée un service et un framework markdown, ultra extensible via plugin, qui permet de créer toute sorte d'application web, de manière declarative, directement depuis le markdown. le framework est aussi dispo via obsidian, avec du one click export et dataview support. Je suis dispo en MP pour ceux que ca interesse, c'est un model freemium et je compte offrir une dizaine de `kit` avant de commencer à sérieusement communiquer dessus. Obsidian + Kit = magic

hello folks, after 6 month of intense creation, i've came up with a markdown framework and service, highly extensible via plugins, that let you build any kind of web sites, directly from the markdown. it also has dataview support. If you'd like to know more shoot me a MP. 

exactement, avec ses propes tradeoffs et particularités. le framework est completement declaratif, dans le frontmatter ou le content, et propose un haut niveau d'abstraction et de control sur l'UI ou l'UX. on peut aussi utiliser et parametrer des plugins ou du theming à la volé directement dans les url. j'ai encore pas mal de taff sur la documentation et la presentation des features, mais l'outil est production ready et dispose d'une vingtaine de plugins out of the box. voici le lien https://publishkit.dev


hello jeremy, following your comment on publish, dataview is not really planned with the publish offer, so does every other community plugins, and even though they just did a css revamp of the service, publish has it's limitations and is not extendable via plugins. I'm just launching a new service (been working on it for the last 6months), very powerful in terms of configuration, that does support dataview and so much more, if you're interested in giving it a try, I'll personnaly assist you and even offer you a free subscription as an early user ^^ just let me know, you can checkout the project at https://publishkit.dev, the documentation is still a work in progress, but the framework is production ready. It is clearly an obsidian publish alternative !

hello i'm louis, a french programmer & entrepreneur. I've been browsing the obsidian publish channel and saw your comment about dataview. obsidian are not planning on integrating community plugins like dataview anytime soon. They revamped the css lately, but no features have been added. I use dataview extensively to create my notes, and needed an easy way to publish and configure the UI, so I've built a complete alternative in the last 6 months, that offers way more than what publish does, starting at 5€/month. I'm starting to communicate about the service, documentation is still in progress, but the framework is production ready and works flawlessly. so if you are interested just let me know, I'll personally assist you so you can publish your vault in one click + export, with dataview support ! have a great day. check the project at https://publishkit.dev

hello daniel i'm louis, a french programmer & entrepreneur. I've been browsing the obsidian publish channel and saw your comment:  "just mentioning that the day dataview works with publish I am caving in and buying a lifetime subscription"

That day has arrived :) obsidian are not planning on integrating community plugins like dataview anytime soon. They revamped the css lately, but no features have been added. I use dataview extensively to create my notes, and needed an easy way to publish and configure the UI, so I've built a complete alternative in the last 6 months, that offers way more than what publish does, starting at 5€/month.

Bonjour João, je suis louis, j'utilise beaucoup obsidian et ta chaine m'as été recommandée par youtube. je suis programmeur de métier et j'avais besoin d'un framework markdown me permettant de concevoir toutes sortes d'applications web, simplement, et rapidement. J'ai donc créé le KIT (https://publishkit.dev), qui permet de transformer n'importe quel contenu markdown en interface web static ou dynamic. De part ses caractéristiques, le kit est une alternative à l'offre publish d'obsidian, mais va bien au delà, en proposant tout un framework et une syntax déclarative permettant de régler au millimètre les pages web, aux travers tout type de plugins. Je lance tout juste le service, et je cherche des early users. Si le projet t'intéresse, je serais ravi de t'en dire plus, t'offrir une suscription et te mettre l'outil entre les mains. J'ai vu que tu avais déjà un site sur publish, très bien customisé d'ailleurs, et je suis certain que vu les skills que tu possèdes, le kit peux vraiment booster ta productivité, car il permet à toutes tes notes/vaults, d'être publiables sur le web en quelque secondes.

je suis dispo quand tu veux par mail ou discord.
au plaisir de discuter.

louis

Hello human, I'm launching a publish alternative that is fully extensible via plugins. I'm about to add a new community comment plugin. I saw your message on the obsidian discord, did you have a particular comment system in mind ? The kit also has SEO features, and all of the tags are available for any plugin to make use of them, maybe display them in the note, or create a tag cloud.

---

hello Petro, I'm launching a markdown publishing service, if you'd like to give it a shot and be an early user, I'll offer you a personnal kit subscription :) the documentation is still a work in progress but the framework is very powerful. you can do what publish can do and a lot more. just let me know. thank you. louis



Hello Daniele, if you are interested to be an early user of the kit, a new markdown publishing service I'm launching, then i'll ship a disqus plugin for you :) or any of the following:

```
paid:

- https://commento.io/ - 10$/m
- https://disqus.com/pricing/ - 11$/m

open source:

- https://utteranc.es/ - github based
- https://giscus.app/fr - github based
- https://lyket.dev/ - likes, ratings, thumbs

```

just let me know, I'm available on the discord anytime.

thank you

(note: Firefox needs `layout.css.has-selector.enabled` set to true in about:config for the kit to work properly)

hello Brian, I'm launching a markdown publishing service, plugin centric and fully extensible, and does support dataview, so if you'd like to give it a shot and be an early user, join the discord and I'll help you publish your TTRPGs :) the documentation is still a work in progress but the framework is very powerful. you can do what publish can do and a lot more. just let me know, i'm in the discord, it will take 5minutes to ship your game online! louis. https://publishkit.dev

hello again :) next week I'm publishing more documentation and guides, but the gist is:
- install the kit plugin in obsidian (the pluggin is not directly available in the community plugins, so for now you have to install it manually or via the obsidian  BRAT plugin)
- enable the plugin, configure your export folder (kit folder)
- once configured, a `kitrc.md` file is created at the root of your vault, it's your kit global configuration (it's all in yaml in the frontmatter of the file)
- leave your conf as is, or fine tune the export by blacklisting/whitelisting files or folders. 
- more about `kitrc` options here https://publishkit.dev/doc/services/kitrc.html
- now run the export command in obisidian, via the command panel, or by clicking the kit icon on the left bar.
- export a single file, or your entire vault.
- make sure you also export the `kitrc.md` file
- now you can see your kit in the browser locally by serving your kit folder. you can do that by navigating to the kit folder in your terminal, and run `npx http-server` or install the kit cli and run `kit serve`
- once your are satisfied, you can publish your kit on any CDN. (I use github pages, it's free, all i have to to is commit and push the folder there)

more in the user guide https://publishkit.dev/doc/index.html

please join the discord, i'd really like to see TTRPG's using the kit, there is a huge potential. also it's a fulltime project, so there are a lot comming.

hello Petro, hope you're doing good. I've reworked all the documentation this week and added a lot of awesome features. I'll push this new version monday. The doc will be just fine, you'll see how simple it is. What you can do maybe is share a github repo with me, with some of your markdown files in it, and i'll walk you the process of publishing, and show you how to make it look like you want, with plugins and widgets.

Ping me anytime starting monday afternoon and i'll set you up!

I think alan watt introduced the concept of predictive programming. Fo the last 2 years I've been part of a very small circle of people seeking to understand the nature of our reality. PP is one of the framework used in mass audience movies and entertainement in general. Technology via the screen (black monolith painted by stanley kubrick 2001 a the space odyssee) is the structural tool for psychological operations, and mass cognitive dissonance. With esoteric and elbarorate techniques, the power of suggestions, hitting the minds of the hive, with repetetion, will create a main stream narrative that people call reality. PP is here to suggest and when it's time to deceive, people connect the dots themselves naturally, thinking they understand, without looking deeper. 
Predictive programming is also cross related to synchronicities, a very interesting part of this reality.

hello kip, just saw your comment on the obsidian channel. If you want to publish your markdown in an effective and powerful way, you should checkout the KIT, it has an obsidian plugin, and support dataview & dataviewjs. https://publishkit.dev/

new realease 1.8.0
- introducing widgets
- documentation ready

---

hello cmjn i'm louis, i saw your comment on the obsidian discord. if you need dataview queries or more advanced features when it comes to rendering your markdown online, make sure to check out the KIT. just join our discord and we'll help you out in case you have any questions. https://publishkit.dev/ 

hello again, following your comment on publish "I would love it if I could stick Metadata in a publish post to have actual Social cards", just wanted to let you know that the kit can do that. make sure you check out the `props` plugin: https://publishkit.dev/doc/plugins/core/props.html and the `card` widget: https://publishkit.dev/doc/widgets/index.html#heading-card

hello Jo I'm louis, following your comment on the obsidian discord channel, just wanted to let you know about the KIT, it has full text search accross your markdown content, and a lot more cool features. you can test out the search here https://publishkit.dev/doc/plugins/core/search.html. If you join the discord, I'd be happy to discuss and optimize your actual usecase, bye!

salut Jo, c'est plus simple si tu es francais ^^ 

1. Is KIT used instead of Publish or as an add-on to Publish?
The KIT is it's own framework. It can do basic publishing like Publish, but it's a full web framework. It has an obsidian plugin you can install if you use obsidian, which will give you additional features like embed and dataview.

3. If it is instead, do I get to keep my graph view:)?
I have not implemented any graph widget yet, but if my clients need one, i'll go for it. it's the whole concept of the kit, to be extensible. I'm planning on delivering tons of plugins this year. already have like 30 plugins/widtgets

5. In either case, do you wanna meet and chat about it?
6. Biensur, on fais un call sur discord quand tu veux. en 2 minutes on render ton vault, ensuite on peut l'optimiser et le configurer pour que ca ressemble à ce que tu veux.

hello imomoe, if you'd like to host your markdown on a private server, check out the KIT, it renders your content in a local folder that you can host anywhere. You can then configure advanced features in your markdown and frontmatter. https://publishkit.dev

hello i'm louis, if you're looking for a plugin based markdown publishing solution, the KIT is offering some cool UI widgets, we can even work on some special widgets for images, like carousels etc. check it out https://publishkit.dev/doc/ui/elements/card.html#heading-multi

hello james I'm louis, following up your comment in the obsidian subreddit, check out the KIT, it is self hosted, and has a lot of plugins/features. you can also blacklist/whitelist any files/folders with regex. make sure you join our discord if you have any questions, we'll set you up and running in no time! have a great weekend! https://publishkit.dev/doc/services/kitrc.html

I've spent the last 6 months building what i currently call a: markdown web framework. the idea is for non tech people like my sister, to be able to publish their notes/blogs/shop/ideas etc just by using markdown. the KIT can be used with zero configuration, or fully tuned to the experience at play. It has a declarative approach, so non tech folks can just enable and customize plugins in the frontmatter by copy pasting documentation. It has an obsidian plugin, where you can 1 click export your vault, or specific files, then up to you where you host the site. I use github pages, it's free. 

And if you are a web dev, you'll love the ease of creating plugins, themes or widgets. You mentionned the read/writeability balance, and that's what the kit is after, a seemless web experience for markdown. that is why i opted for raw html tags to fence widgets, so it is invisible and out of the way in reading mode, but will render once hosted. you also get dynamic props and data binding, like in react, vue and the like. it's community based, and I work full time on the project, recently joined by other devs in my company. The KIT is free for OSS projects or local sites. it starts at 5€/month for personnal sites, and 50€/month for business sites.

Note: the kit website is itself powered with the kit, you can look at the markdown sources [here](https://github.com/publishkit/vault), and the exported site [here](https://github.com/publishkit/publishkit.github.io) 

cheers, hope you'll have fun using the KIT. any feedback, good or bad, is appreciated, and if you'd like to see custom plugins, just join are discord, we'll happilly make things work!




Tim ozman (with a Z, because tim osman with an S is the name of ossama ben laden :) is a very interesting guy, his works consist of studying what he call the "meta script", which is the constructed narrative used in the media military entertainement complex, to trick the masses by feeding them a fake reality. his platform is called the infinite plane society, but make no mistake he is not a flat earther, he is not a globe believer either ^^


hello bagel, you should try the KIT. it's free for OSS projects, has community themes & plugins, and can be used via the obsidian plugin, or the CLI for direct integration. Note that by just using the CLI, you loose all the PKM features, like wikilinks, dataview, embeds etc. so using the obsidian plugin is recommanded. it's 1 click export in the app. then you you can host your kit folder anywhere, just make it a repo and push it to github pages. I'll be on the discord if you have any questions. https://publishkit.dev/ have a good day

hello scott, just saw your comment on the obsidian discord,  i run a couple sites with the KIT it's pretty advanced compared to Publish, it's plugin based and has full text search support in titles, headers and paragraphs. https://publishkit.dev/doc/plugins/core/search.html Also If you want to maintain a list of updated notes, you could simple write a dataview query, which the kit support. You can export a website in seconds, and host it anywhere (i host everything on github pages). it's also a full time project and actively maintened, features are comming out every week.  I'm the main dev of the kit, if you need any help just join our discord ! have a good day sir

i use dataview everywhere, it's the best plugin to build dynamic documentation. I can then 1 click export my notes with the KIT and publish my folder on github pages. https://publishkit.dev/

hello Tostitos, if you are looking for a reliable markdown publishing framework, with full text search and andvanced plugins, check out https://publishkit.dev/doc/plugins/core/search.html, very easy to use. I'll be in the discord if you have any question. have a good day !

hello hamilton, try the KIT, it already has 1 payment gateway (chargebee - https://publishkit.dev/doc/plugins/community/chargebee.html). And if you already have an idea on a paywall workflow, i can create create a new plugin for the KIT. Just let me know. if you have any question I'm on the kit discord. have a good day.

iI'll create a "paywall plugin", just need more spec :)

hey guys, just to get the temperature, i'm looking at rental, a lot of places has been booked already, so got to act fast. how long should i book ? 2 weeks ? june / july, / august ? what's the trend ??


Bonjour Laurent, j'habite aix en provence et cherchais un lieu à 2 pas de chez moi afin de loger 3 amis (américain et australiens) qui viennent me nous rendre visite cet été (22juillet/12aout). C'est la première fois que j'utilise abritel, peut être pouvons nous passer en direct ? comme indiqué dans votre annonce je vous contact pour en savoir plus, merci - louis grellet



abhuva — Aujourd’hui à 00:44
hello, i have a question: is it possible to use the frontmatter variable "publish:true" to determine wether a note should be published or excluded?
This would make the switch from Obsidians inbuild publish functionality a breeze...
abhuva — Aujourd’hui à 03:43
second question: why do i need to input credit card details when trying to get the free kit? Is this intended? 
Also, is there an option to just use paypal without a credit card if i want to use the paid option?

hello abhuva, welcome to the kit. 

- thanks you, good feedback about the `publish: true`  in the frontmatter, i'm going to add that feature. the kit strategy as of now is white/blacklisting notes or folder via regex in the frontmatter of the main configuration file (the `kitrc.md`, which is auto created after installing the obsidian plugin). https://publishkit.dev/doc/services/kitrc.html

```
vault:
  kit_folder: /Users/louis/mykitfolder
  include: 
    - '^(kitrc|index|navbar).md$'
    - '^blog/'
    - '^notes/'
  exclude: 
    - '^kit/'
    - '^templates/'
    - '^blog/draft'
```

- Concerning payments, I use https://www.chargebee.com/, which is a subscriptions service on top of a Stripe account. The FREE plan is actually a Plan with a price of `0€`, they still ask for cards details and basic billing informations, but nothing is ever debited. The Free plan receives a monthly invoice of 0€.
- For your information, you don't have to subscribe to any plans before publishing, by simply using the kit locally. Just install the obsidian plugin, export your files, and serve your folder in the browser. It's only when you'll finally ready to publish, that you'll need  a subscription in order to obtain a `site.id` (a token).
- I have not added the paypal method yet, but if you need it, i'll try to open a new paypal account next week.

I'm here anytime to help you setup and tune your kit.


hey abhuva, look like we are not on the same timezone :)
I'm from france, where are you from ?

I totally understand what you mean with obsidian publish. that's exactly why I started this project. I use a lot of markdown, and needed a tool to ship content fast without hasle, in a powerful way.

The project is already pretty advanced in term of features, and I'm in the process of building a dedicated team on the project. In the mean time I do my best to enhance the framework.

So this weekend I'll try to implement the `publish=true` fallback, so it's more convinient for people coming from obsidian.

As for the plugin doing nothing, I know what the problem is, a client of mine already raised the point. The kit has been tested only on unix systems (mac & linux), and windows uses a different filesystem. It's a little fix in the pathname of files that I have to write, it should take an hour max to fix & ship it, the thing is I don't have a window machine. So next week my mission is to get my hand on a PC and fix that problem.

I'm sorry that you did not get the full working experience of the kit out of the box, and for now, with window machine, you will be stuck. but please bare with me, once this is fixed and you are it's all setup, it's very easy to use it, and will take like 5minutes to tune, export and ship your website.

If you want we can have a chat this weekend, anytime, i can tell you some good tips & how you can leverage your content with the kit, so If you'd like to share your actual "Publish" site with me, please do, that will help me in leading you into the right direction.


talk to you soon

louis

hello, well i tried :) my dad gave me a pc laptop, i have not used a windows since window 98 ^^ i tried to install all the required lib to run a nodejs environnement for me to debug via obsidian, but the machine was to slow. I gave up, It's to much effort for me to debug that path problem, which is a small thing, but gets very hard when not familiar with the system. that's why I'm in the process of hiring some devs that already use windows. but that's mid term. So i'm very sorry you can not use the KIT as is, the only way for now is to use a unix system (mac or linux). 

On the framework side of things, the KIT is production ready and way more powerful than Publish in terms of architecture and possibilities, even though they lowered their price. I'm doing a break feature wise untill september to gather a small team, it's my main focus, i'm expending my solo tech studio (studio1337.tech) and want to dev a series of high quality services around markdown and the web, so stay tuned!


hello davsama, the Kit is a publishing framework for markdown, and because it renders content pre publishing, you'll be able to publish notes with embeds without needing their sources (not possible with publish). if you have any questions hit me up on the discord! https://publishkit.dev

hey man, I'm here if you need to. sorry for last night, was sleeping. I'm from france, what's your timezone ?

ok so couple things from what you said:
- you found the CLI export command :) but that command is not meant to work, and will be removed. (not your fault, as a dev I would have run that command too)
- so you have to export via obsidian
- once you export a note, the export directory should contain your `note.html` and a file `kitdb.json` 
- make sure you also export your `kit.md` file, resulting in a `kitrc.json` in the export folder as well
- now serve you directory, it should work.




ps: the CLI for now is usefull for 2 things:
	- in a vault directory, using `kit ls` will show you the markdown files that matched with the includes/excludes rules of the kitrc.
	- in the export folder, running the `kit serve` will serve your folder. 
	- i have not pushed latest CLI version, which contain `kit` instead of `pk` as a package name 


you can checkout the actual website vault here https://github.com/publishkit/vault

We can do a call chat anytime, i'm here all day working on the kit !

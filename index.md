# hello human !

I'm an independent software architect, designer & tech entrepreneur living in the south of France. It all started in 1999, my first website, a html/css GIF library coded with "Microsoft FrontPage", served through a 56 kilobytes AOL modem. Fun times :)

24 years later, after many great tech and business adventures, I'm opening my tech studio, a playground to practice my art, sharpen my skills, and craft unique pieces of software and services.

Interest & knowledge:

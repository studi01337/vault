 Kal.io (for calendar) is a dead simple visual time scheduler where you can seamlessly book resources and assign them to other shared resources. UX is the primary goal of this project, and the calendar is designed to render on very small devices. Kalio is mainly used by flight schools. It's so easy that pilots can safely book planes on their phones while flying the aircraft :) (tested myself)

 It started with an online safe space for families to organize and commemorate the loss of their loved ones.
 
 I've built the entire service from scratch. I architected and implemented custom software, enhancing (10x?) the funeral workflows, redefining the funeral business from the ground up.
 
 5 years, 60 employees in & out, and a 20Mâ‚¬ B series later, the company extended its model to physical funeral services. Due to unethical practices and pressure at the top, being the only independent individual in the new employee/resource model corp, it was ironically time for me to end my collaboration with the project I fully crafted :)
 
 Huge respect for the people working with the families. I hope my work improves the quality of your time. It came from my gut & my heart.

 Markdown publishing framework, as a service !
 
 The `kit` renders markdown into any kind of web application, and with the use of plugins and declarative syntax, you can customize every aspect of your pages, in seconds!
 
 The kit renders your content into static HTML pages, inside a folder, that can be hosted anywhere.
 
 Project documentations, blogs, wikis, digital gardens, academia, table-top games, shops... The kit just seats on top of your content, and gives you full control over the UI & UX.
